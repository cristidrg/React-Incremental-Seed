# React-Incremental-Seed

This project displays state management done solely in react without the usage of Redux/MobX or other shenanigans.

The purpose of this project is to create a seed for developing incremental games (like cookie clicker).

The codebase is commented, however I suggest starting here: https://github.com/cristidrg/React-Incremental-Seed/blob/master/src/index.js

To install this project simply run npm install and then npm run start .
